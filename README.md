# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This is a small project that displays a simple page where the user can play rock-paper-scissors game against the computer.
The game ends when a player wins 5 rounds. Each round, the user's input is collected and a random computer choice is generated.

This project allowed me to write a JS script that interacts dynamically with the HTML page and its elements.
